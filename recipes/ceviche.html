    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>400g fish fillet</li>
        <li>250g leche de tigre</li>
        <li>100g red onions</li>
        <li>1 lime</li>
        <li>5g salt</li>
        <li>5g ajinomoto glutamate</li>
        <li>5g coriander</li>
        <li>5g chili cut, no seeds</li>
        <li>1 avocado</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Cut the red onions in julienne (long thin strips) and put 
            them into a bowl with water and ice to lose the aggressive 
            onion flavor and get more crunchy.
        </li>
        <li>
            Take out all the fish bones from the fish filet and cut the 
            filet into cubes, approximately 1 cm x 1 cm.
        </li>
        <li>
            Put the fish cubes into a bowl and season with salt, 
            ajinomoto, and lime juice. Mix everything well.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the onions, the leche de tigre, and mix again.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cut the coriander leaves and the chilies (without 
            the seeds), add to the mixture, and stir again.
        </li>
        <li>
            Plate, and distribute the marinade evenly, 
            so every plate has the same amount of letche the tigre. Cut the avocado in slices and place on the plates.
        </li>
    </ol>
