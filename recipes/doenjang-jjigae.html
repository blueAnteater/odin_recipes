   <p>An amazing and comforting Doenjang-jjigae recipe for those cloudy days.</p>
   <p>When a Korean mom chooses the first real meal for her baby, 
    she chooses doenjang-jjigae (or soup made with soybean paste, doenjang-guk) with fluffy white rice. 
    To make it go down easy she mixes the stew with the rice and feeds it to her child. 
    Years later, when the child is grown and living far away, she makes it for them 
    whenever they come home again, because every child has ingrained memories of mom’s doenjang-jjigae. 
    It’s something they know and love and are always comforted with.</p>
