        <h1>Pizza Recipe</h1>
        <p>
            This is perhaps the most authentic Neapolitan pizza recipe you will find! 
            What’s more, it’s really easy with just 4 ingredients; flour, water, 
            salt, and yeast.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>640g Flour</li>
            <li>360g Water</li>
            <li>14g Salt</li>
            <li>0.5g Yeast</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Mix all the ingredients into a shaggy mass in a large bowl, 
                starting by adding the water first. You can do this by hand 
                or use a wooden spoon.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cover the bowl with cling film, a plastic carrier bag, or a 
                damp cloth (if the cloth isn’t damp the dough may dry out).
            </li>
            <li>
                Leave the dough to rest for around 1 hour (the technical 
                term for this process is the Autolyse).
            </li>
            <li>
                Turn the dough out onto the counter and knead for around 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place the dough back into the bowl and cover tightly.
            </li>
            <li>
                Leave the dough to prove (in one big lump, don’t worry 
                too much about the shape) for around 20 hours.
            </li>
            <li>
                Divide the dough into 4 equal parts (250g each) using some 
                kitchen scales and a knife (or dough scraper). Do this about 
                4 hours before you intend to cook the pizza (after about a 20 hour prove).
            </li>
            <li>
                Place each dough ball into a small bowl and cover. 
                Alternatively, use a large tupperware container with a lid, 
                or two smaller ones.
            </li>
            <li>
                Leave the dough balls to prove again for about 4-6 hours.
            </li>
            <li>
                Blend a tin of quality plum tomatoes into a smooth sauce.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cook the sauce until it reaches the desired thickness 
                (still runny but quite thick).
            </li>
            <li>
                Add a tablespoon or 2 of tomato puree for a richer, 
                sweeter sauce (optional).
            </li>
            <li>
                Season with salt and pepper to taste.
            </li>
        </ol>
